# Xylophone

## This is an application developed by me while following The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp By Dr. Angela Yu.

### About the project 

This is a simple application with 7 buttons, the purpose of each button is to play different notes of the song making this application a little xylophone, the application was built to practice AVFoundation and AVAudioPlayer.

The project was developed with a storyboard.

### How it works

All the buttons have their own sender each is the same name of each file added to the assets of this project, so when Button A is pressed, the application plays the fila A each is the song of the note A.

### ‚öíÔ∏è Tools used by me to design and develop this application:

- Xcode 
- Swift
